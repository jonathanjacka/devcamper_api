# DevCamper API

> Backend API for DevCamper application, which is a bootcamp directory website.

## Acknowledgements

I created this project through a course on Udemy.com by Brad Traversy: https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/

## Usage

To use, you'll need to rename "config/config.env.env" to "config/config.env" and update the missing values and settings to your own. If you're new to all this, doing the course linked above will be a great help in understanding what needs to be completed.
